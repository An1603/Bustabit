                <p>
                    Binance coin gambling is a general term for any type of gambling wherein bets are placed in units of
                    binance coins as opposed to a fiat currency or any other asset. Learn more about

                <p>
                    Place a bet. Watch the multiplier increase from 1x upwards! Cash out any time to get your bet
                    multiplied by that multiplier. But be careful because the game can bust at any time, and you'll get nothing!

                <b><a name="bnbs"></a>What is a bnbs?</b>
                <p>
                    1 BNB = 1,000,000 bnbs . At the time of this writing, a single bnbs is worth roughly $0.0003 USD.
                    You are able to deposit and withdraw bnbs at any time by going to your <a href="/account">account page</a>.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="deposit" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="deposit"></a>How do I deposit bnbs?</b>
                <p>
                    You will need to transfer binance coins to the deposit address on your account page. If you do not have any binance coins,
                    we can recommend <a href="https://www.binance.com/">Binance</a> if you are in the US (although the registration process
                    is lengthy). You can also search online to see if there are any
                    binance coin ATMs near you. And remember, you can withdraw directly to the binance coin address on
                    your account page!

                <p>
                    It is <strong>permanently</strong> attached to your account. You can save it, or use it for automatic
                    funding, or whatever else you like. All payments to this address will be automatically credited to your account.
                </p>

                <b><a name="deposit-time"></a>How long do deposits take to be credited?</b>
                <p>
                    We instantly credit accounts upon a single confirmation, which on average is approximately 10 minutes from the time of the transaction.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="withdraw" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="withdraw"></a>How do I withdraw bnbs?</b>
                <p>
                    On your account page, you can transfer bnbs to any binance coin address you want. Small withdrawals
                    (i.e. smaller than the balance of our hot-wallet) are processed instantly and you will be given the transaction ID immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Larger withdrawals will be shown in your withdrawal page as "PENDING" and will require us to manually remove
                    sufficient funds from our cold storage. Usually this process will take less than two hours, but may take up to 24 hours,
                    depending on the time of day and other circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We remove 2% from any withdrawal amount to cover mining fees. We charge this amount
                    <strong>regardless</strong> of the actual mining fees attached to the transaction, which may be more or less
                    than this, depending on the block competition at the time of your withdrawal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Withdrawals must be in increments of 1 bnbs, with a minimum withdrawal of 25000 bnbs (of which 100 bnbs
                    goes towards the mining fee). As required, we will chip in our own money to help expedite confirmation time, such that
                    we typically pay 200 bnbs in mining fees, despite charging you only 2% total withdraw.

                <b><a name="gross-profit"></a> What is gross profit?</b>
                <p>
                    Gross profit refers to the sum of the profit from each game you've played without considering your loses.

                <p>
                    Upon detecting that you have disconnected we cash you out (assuming the game is still in progress).
                    Regardless of whether your client is connected or not, the <em>auto cash-out</em> feature will work as expected (it happens on
                    the server), and we highly recommend you use it if internet reliability or performance is a concern.

                <b><a name="high"></a>How high can the game go?</b>
                <p>
                    There's no real limit! However, if during a game we ever are facing a net loss of 3% of the bankroll or greater,
                    the server will automatically cash out all players still in the game, forcing them to enjoy an early win and a sizeable profit.
                    You can see in game what the current max win is (in the bottom right of the chart)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="limit" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="limit"></a>What is the most I can bet?</b>
                <p>
                    We currently have a bet limit of 10,000,000 bnbs (10 BNB).
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="last" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="last"></a>What is the bonus?</b>
                <p>
                    The bonus is a special prize that is awarded to the last people to cash out before the game busted. Getting the bonus
                    is critical to skillful playing of bnbbest, as it is the <strong>only</strong> way to overcome house odds.
                </p>
                <p>1% of each player's stake goes into the bonus pot. So if there are 4 players, betting 400, 300, 200, and 100, there will be 10 bnbs in the pot.
                    If the biggest player wins, he gets the whole pot. The site works out the rate he would be getting if he won, ie. 400 bnbs bet gives 10 bnbs bonus
                    - or 1/40th bonus per bit bet. It then applies the same rate to whoever actually wins.
                </p>
                <p>So if the 100 bit player wins, he gets 1/40th of 100, or 2.5 bnbs. That leaves 7.5 bnbs in the pot,
                    which goes to the next best placing player(s).
                </p>
                <p>Suppose the 200 bit player comes 2nd. He is due 1/40th of 200, or 5 bnbs. There are still 7.5 bnbs in the pot,
                    so he gets the full 5 bnbs he is due - the same as if he had come in 1st place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suppose the 300 bit player comes 3rd. He's due 7.5 bnbs (300/40) but there are only 2.5 bnbs left in the pot, so he gets those and that's all. There's nothing left for the 4th or worse place players.
                </p>
                <p>
                    1% of games will instant bust (0x) and no bonuses will be awarded, all other games have bonuses equal to 1% of the amount wagered.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="odds" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="odds"></a>What are the game odds?</b>
                <p>
                    The house margin is scaled between 0 and 1 %, depending on how long you hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The numbers are baked into the game, so you never need to worry about it. We do not
                    have a fixed house margin, as this would prevent highly conservative play (e.g. If you were
                    only attempting to make $2 in a $100 game, a house margin of 1 % would be 50 % of your potential profits!).
                    Our unique formula makes it fair for both highly conservative play (cash out early) and highly aggressive
                    play (hold until you're a millionaire). All games are <a href="#fair" data-toggle="pill" role="tab" >provably fair</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The exact formula for the houses expected return is:<br />
                    <code>1 % * (intendedCashOut - roomAmount) * (roomAmount / intendedCashOut)</code><br />
                    But to really get a good sense of how this affects you, please use our handy <a href="/calculator">odds calculator</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The other important thing to keep in mind is that every game has a 1 % chance of instantly busting. We do not make
                    <strong>any</strong> money on it, but rather use this to fund the bonus scheme. This is an important consideration to make if you
                    are playing in such a way that you never win the bonus.

                <img src="/img/house-edge.png">
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="crash-point" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="crash-point"></a>How is the game bust calculated?</b>
                <p>
                    It basically does three things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, it mixes the hash with the clientSeed (decided by the provably fair seeding event) using hmac-sha256
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly it gives a 1 in 101 chance of instant busting
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, it works out what the multiplier would be if there was no
                    house edge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fourth, it takes 1% off the multiplier and adds on 0.01x:
                </p>
                <p>
                    So half the time (other than 0x bust which we can ignore because
                    they pay for themselves with the bonus) the multiplier will be 1.99x
                    or more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That means if we bet 1.99x we have a 50% chance of winning (again,
                    ignoring 0x busts), and so the house edge is:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>100 - (1.99 * 50) = 100 - 99.5 = 0.5%</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The extra 0.01 that gets added on to the multiplier is half of the 1%
                    that was taken off in this case, leaving the house edge at 0.5%. As
                    the multiplier gets bigger, the 1% that is taken off gets bigger, and
                    the 0.01x that gets added on becomes less and less significant,
                    causing the house edge to tend to 1%
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="fair" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="fair"></a>Is the game fair?</b>
                <p>
                    Yes! In fact, this is someting that we're especially interested in. If you already know your way around the BaB seeding.

            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade " id="force" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="pills-home-tab">
                <b><a name="force"></a>What happens when the server forces people to cash out?</b>
                <p>
                    Under some circumstances the server will force people to cash out. The most common reason is that the game multiplier
                    has gotten so large that we are risking too much of our bankroll (10 % or more). Another possible reason is
                    unexpected server problems. If more than one person in a game is affected by the forced
                    cash-out, we allocate the last cash-out bonus to a random player.
